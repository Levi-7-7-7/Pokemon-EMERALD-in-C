# Pokémon Emerald Decompilation

## About

This repository contains a **decompiled version** of the Pokémon Emerald game for the Game Boy Advance (GBA).  
Originally, the game was written primarily in the **C programming language**.

I am actively working on understanding the game mechanisms to deepen my knowledge of game development.  
This project serves as a learning journey to explore and dissect how a classic game like Pokémon Emerald is built under the hood.

### Goals:
- Explore the game's source code and mechanics  
- Learn about game development and low-level programming  
- Experiment with modifications and improvements  

---

Feel free to explore, contribute, or share your insights!
